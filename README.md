#### Geospatial Data Science: the science that investigates the 'where' and 'why' of various human and natural phenomena!

+ I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Geospatial Information Sciences at the University of Texas at Dallas (å¾·å·žå¤§å­¦è¾¾æ‹‰æ–¯åˆ†æ ¡). My research interests include Geographic Information Science (GIS), Urban Environment, and Human Networks Modeling. More specifically, I am interested in applying geospatial big data, machine learning, and cloud computing (e.g. AWS) to study the interaction among built environments and social events, semantic segmentation of urban, navigation with map matching, etc. I am also passionate about developing helpful applications for local societies.
